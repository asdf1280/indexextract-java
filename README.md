# WARNING: Archived Project
> This project is no longer maintained and has been archived. I have now decided to develop a new indexectract program based on C# WPF. indexxtract-java is no longer developed because of Java's speed problems, functional limitations, and the fact that Java is trash.
> 
> For now, you can use the [indexextract-dotnet](https://github.com/dhkim0800/indexextract-dotnet) version. This version will also be archived once the WPF version is developed, but it is still being maintained and works perfectly.
>
> Thank you for paying attention to indexextract-java if you did so. And I wish we meet with the all new indexextract-wpf version. Bye Java!
